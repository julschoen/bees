# LSTM and GRU based Timeseries forecasting of Beehive weight
* Data based on the [trachtnet network](https://www.bienenkunde.rlp.de/Internet/global/inetcntr.nsf/dlr_web_full.xsp?src=X9G7276H32&p1=F0O6NVM2F0&p3=5PW3P32TF7&p4=HY3576SY58)
* Feature selection for improved forecasting
* Attempted to improve forecasting by clustering beehives based on different approaches
* Both LSTM and GRU for forecasting are implemented using Tensorflow/Keras and tuned using KerasTuner
