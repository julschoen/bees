# LSTM and GRU based Timeseries forecasting of Beehive weight
* Data based on the trachtnet network
* Feature selection for improved forecasting
* Attempted to improve forecasting by clustering beehives based on different approaches
* Both LSTM and GRU for forecasting are implemented using Tensorflow/Keras and tuned using KerasTuner
